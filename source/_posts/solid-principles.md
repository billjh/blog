Principles to follow for better OOP programs.

<!-- more -->

**Single Responsibility Principle**
A class should have a single responsibility.

**Open-closed Principle**
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

**Liskov Substitution Principle**
Another way to say is to program against contract (interface).

**Interface Segregation Principle**
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

**Dependency Inversion Principle**
One should "depend upon abstraction, [not] concretion".
